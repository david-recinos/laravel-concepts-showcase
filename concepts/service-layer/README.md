# Service Layer Pattern

The Service Layer moves business logic out of controllers and into dedicated classes.

## When to Use
- Multi-step workflows
- Complex business rules
- Cases where controllers become large or repetitive
- When improving testability and separation of concerns

## Benefits
- Clean, slim controllers
- Easier unit testing
- Reusable domain logic
- Improved maintainability

## Example Workflow
Controller → Service → Model

(Implementation example will be added.)
